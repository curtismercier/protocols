# Breath Cycle — Specification v0.2

> A lifecycle model for AI agent sessions that embraces context depletion as a design constraint rather than a limitation.

## 1. The Insight

Most frameworks treat the context window as a problem to solve — make it bigger (long context), make it searchable (RAG), make it infinite (external memory).

The Breath Cycle treats it differently: **the context window is a breath.** It fills, it empties, it fills again. The agent knows this and prepares for it.

An agent that knows it will forget is more capable than one that pretends it won't.

## 2. The Four Phases

```
    ┌─── INHALE ───┐
    │ Load identity │
    │ Read preload  │
    │ Init memory   │
    └───────┬───────┘
            │
    ┌───────▼───────┐
    │    PROCESS    │
    │  Work, think  │
    │ Context fills  │
    └───────┬───────┘
            │
    ┌───────▼───────┐
    │    EXHALE     │
    │ Detect 85%    │
    │ Extract state │
    │ Write preload │
    └───────┬───────┘
            │
    ┌───────▼───────┐
    │     REST      │
    │Between sessions│
    │Memory on disk  │
    └───────────────┘
```

### 2.1 Inhale (Boot)

The agent wakes up and orients itself.

1. **Discover identity** — find `.soma/identity.md`, learn who it is here
2. **Check for preload** — find `preload-next.md`, learn where the last session left off
3. **Load relevant muscles** — read memory files that match the current context/project
4. **Orient** — "Here's who I am, here's where we left off, here's what I know"

The inhale should be fast. The agent isn't re-learning — it's remembering.

### 2.2 Process (Work)

The agent works with the human. Context accumulates.

- Every user message uses context
- Every assistant response uses context
- Every tool call (file read, command execution) uses context
- Context usage is monitored continuously (extension or built-in)

The agent is aware of its remaining capacity. This isn't a background concern — it influences behavior. An agent at 40% context works differently from one at 75%.

### 2.3 Exhale (Flush)

Context is running out. The agent prepares for the transition.

1. **Threshold detected** — context usage exceeds limit (default: 85%)
2. **Extract state** — what was accomplished, what's in progress, what's next
3. **Write preload** — session continuation document (see AMP spec)
4. **Crystallize** — if a new pattern emerged, write a muscle
5. **Signal** — indicate readiness for continuation or termination

The exhale is deliberate, not panicked. The agent has been aware of its depleting context throughout the process phase.

**Checkpoints:** On exhale, the agent also commits state to its checkpoint tracks (see AMP spec §8). The internal track (`.soma/` local git) captures memory changes. The project track captures code checkpoints. These provide diffs on the next inhale — "what changed since I was last here?" — without re-reading everything.

### 2.4 Rest (Between Sessions)

The agent isn't running, but its memory persists.

- Muscles remain on disk, ready for the next inhale
- Preload waits to be consumed
- The human can modify memory between sessions (edit muscles, adjust preloads)
- Nothing is lost — just sleeping

## 3. Continuation

When exhale leads directly to a new inhale (auto-continuation):

```
Session N:   inhale → process → exhale
                                  ↓
Session N+1: inhale → process → exhale
                                  ↓
Session N+2: inhale → process → exhale → rest
```

Auto-continuation enables long-running tasks that exceed a single context window. The agent works until done, breathing as needed.

Requirements for auto-continuation:
- Preload written successfully
- New session can be started programmatically
- The new session's inhale consumes the preload from the previous exhale

## 4. Context Awareness

The agent should know its own context state. Suggested thresholds:

| Context Used | State | Agent Behavior |
|-------------|-------|---------------|
| 0-40% | Fresh | Full exploration, read files freely |
| 40-65% | Working | Normal operation, mindful of reads |
| 65-80% | Warning | Prioritize, avoid unnecessary reads |
| 80-85% | Critical | Prepare for exhale, start extracting |
| 85%+ | Flush | Execute exhale sequence |

These thresholds are guidelines, not hard rules. Implementations may adjust based on the model's context window size.

## 5. Why "Breath"

The metaphor isn't decoration. It shapes design decisions:

- **Breathing is natural.** Flush isn't failure — it's the exhale that enables the next inhale.
- **Sessions are breaths, not lifetimes.** Each one is complete in itself but part of a longer life.
- **You can't hold your breath forever.** Context is finite. Accept it.
- **Breathing is rhythmic.** The cycle repeats. The agent gets better at it over time.
- **Breathing out isn't losing.** The exhale (flush) preserves what matters. The rest is exhaled.

## 6. Implementation Notes

- The Breath Cycle works with any context window size (4K, 128K, 1M tokens)
- Larger context windows mean longer breaths, not the elimination of breathing
- The flush threshold should be tuned to the model and use case
- Auto-continuation requires framework support (session management, programmatic restart)
